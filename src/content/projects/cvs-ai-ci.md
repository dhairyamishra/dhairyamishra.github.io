## Overview

A transformer-powered image alt-text compliance system that automatically generates and validates accessible alt-text for images at CVS Health. The project began as a hackathon prototype and matured into a production CI pipeline.

## Origin: 1st Prize at CVS GenAI Hackathon (Aug 2023)

Won 1st Prize for a proof-of-concept that used Hugging Face vision-language models to **generate and compare alt-text for images and test them for accessibility compliance**. Combined transformer-based caption generation with sentiment analysis to flag tone issues alongside coverage gaps.

## Productionization

After the hackathon, established production-grade pipelines for enterprise rollout under the CPE web-core CI/CD standards. The system runs on every pull request and:

- **Generates candidate alt-text** for new images using vision-language transformers
- **Compares against existing alt-text** to flag missing or inaccurate copy
- **Scores compliance** against WCAG/ADA requirements with sentiment-aware checks
- **Reports inline** in GitHub Actions and Slack to keep accessibility shifted left

## Impact

- **35% boost** in accessibility conformance after hackathon prototype rollout (per A11yScore baseline)
- **15% reduction** in downstream defects after productionization for enterprise rollout
- Catches visual/copy regressions traditional snapshot testing misses
- Foundation for the CVS accessibility org's automated CI quality gates

## Tech Stack

- **AI/ML**: Hugging Face Transformers, vision-language models, sentiment analysis
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, custom pipeline orchestration, Slack reporting
- **Backend**: Python
- **Validation**: WCAG/ADA rule evaluation, A11yScore baseline metrics
