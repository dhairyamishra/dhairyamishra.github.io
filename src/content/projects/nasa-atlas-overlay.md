## Overview

Atlas Overlay is a construction planning tool that combines NASA satellite imagery with terrain segmentation and CV-based site analysis to give pre-build engineering teams a richer, automated view of any candidate construction site. Submitted to the NASA SpaceApps Challenge 2021 in Cleveland, OH and recognized at Trine University's STEM Symposium.

## Awards

- **1st Place — Galactic Impact**, NASA SpaceApps Challenge (Cleveland, OH, 2021)
- **Best Trine Research Project — Engineering Multi-Departmental**, Trine University STEM Symposium

## Role

Led a cross-disciplinary team across CS, Civil Engineering, and Geosciences. Owned the technical architecture, CV pipeline, and demo integration.

## Key Features

- **NASA Satellite Imagery Ingest**: Pulled multi-band satellite tiles for any candidate site and aligned them with local terrain data.
- **Terrain Segmentation**: CV-based analysis of overlay gradients, slope, and surface composition to flag risk zones.
- **ArcGIS Visualization**: Layered the segmentation outputs onto interactive ArcGIS maps for site planners.
- **Autodesk Revit Integration**: Generated realistic building data and structures from the overlay analysis to support reliable pre-planning.

## Tech Stack

- **GIS**: NASA satellite imagery datasets, ArcGIS
- **CAD**: Autodesk Revit (parametric building generation)
- **Computer Vision**: Terrain segmentation, gradient analysis
- **Tooling**: Python, image processing libraries
